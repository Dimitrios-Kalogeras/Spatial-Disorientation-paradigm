# Spatial-Disorientation-paradigm
Here you can find the MATLAB script, used to develop necesery files to conduct the experiment described in my Thesis project.
This script produces .CSV files with two columns, VELOCITY and TIME. In esense, the script plots velocity to time, in a sampling rate of 10 Hz.
The .CSV were used to control a servo controlled rotating chair.
This script accepts as input the number of subjects, and creates 24 randomized trials -in two blocks of 12 trials.
The stimuli that are produced utilize post-rottary effects to create conflicting motion cues between dark and light conditions.

Feel free to cobntact me (d.kalogeras@acg.edu) for further details on the script, or about the design and results of the study.
